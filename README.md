# FYP (Flash Your Python)  
(Work in progress since - 26 July 2025 - 5AM)  

# Intro
Choose who wins the war for your attention. Flash Your Python (before getting into your "for you page"). Syntax quiz/revision tool.  

Answering correctly launches your preferred social media platform and FYP closes.  

Disclaimer: Easy way is for android use, hard way is for WSL2 demo production.  

# Installation (the EASY way)

1 - Download ONLY the "FYP.apk" file from my GitHub repo (https://github.com/SREILLIC/FYP).  
2 - Install it on your ANDROID device.  
3 - If you don't see it, that's because apk creation failed on the last step...again.

# Installation (the HARD way - for making your own kivy apps in WSL2):  
If you didn't know, WSL2 is basically Linux installed unto Windows!  
It might help to join the discord (https://discord.gg/bootdotdev)  

Type/paste code into the CLI terminal emulator of WSL2.

## 1 - Download FYP(clone my repo) and cd into FYP dir

    git clone https://github.com/SREILLIC/FYP

## 2 - Install python3.9 and it's environment
not available by default on WSL2, so I added deadsnakes PPA(3rd-party at own risk).  
It‚Äôs a popular Ubuntu repository for installing older or alternative Python versions.  

    sudo apt install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    sudo apt update

    sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-venv python3.9-dev

## 3 - Install global dependencies (Takes about 15 minutes at 5mbps internet speed)
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y \
    git zip unzip openjdk-17-jdk python3-pip \
    libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev \
    libportmidi-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev \
    zlib1g-dev libgstreamer1.0 libgstreamer1.0-dev \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly \
    libmtdev-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev \
    libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libffi-dev \
    libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev

## 4 - Setup python environment
create:  
    python3.9 -m venv .venv3_9
activate:  
    source .venv3_9/bin/activate

## 5 - Install environmental dependencies (while still in FYP dir)
(for testing your app):  
    pip install Kivy==2.3.1
    pip install pygame==2.6.1
    pip install Cython==0.29.36
    pip install pyjnius==1.5.0

## 6 - Launch (demo of app in WSL2)
Make sure android specific functions are caught with print("error") to avoid crashes.  
Example: webbrowser for opening URL vs using powershell.exe to open URL
    python3 main.py

## 7 - apk - android install file
Install buildozer:  
    pip install buildozer
Make buildozer.spec:  
    buildozer init
Configure buildozer according to how you want your apk.  
Use editor of choice (like VS code) or:  
    nano buildozer.spec
Make apk (first time can take up to an hour, depending on internet):  
    buildozer android debug

# Some more info
## Version choices
buildozer (to make apk) only works on WSL2.  

A kivy(?) requirement called "distutils" was removed from python3.11 and onwards.  
python3.10 was not a available on deadsnakes PPA, but is theoretically compatible with kivy.  
Thus, python3.9 (latest version compatible with kivy and available on deadsnakes-PPA).  

Cython0.29.36 is latest version compatible with buildozer.  

## Personal(public)
Planning and development has been ongoing since 25 July 2025.

This is my first real coding project that I started for the bootdev hackathon 2025.  
I made a demo, submitted it for the hackathon, then rm -rf'd the ever loving orbital-nuke out of my local+GitHub folders/files, and related social media posts, because I hated how dumb my app was compared to other so-called "amateur" entries.  

A day later I realized that I'm actually doing okay'ish, considering:  
1. First month in coding.
2. First ever coding project.
3. Solo app development.
4. Kivy is kinda niche/old (I think?) and I learnt it in the same weekend.
5. Essentially did a full-stack project while only learning backend in bootdev.

So I remade the entire app and even improved functionality.   

I tried making it as easy as possible for you to install, while maintaining transparency as I'm still an unknown author.  

I used Anaconda/Jupyter notebooks for project plan to keep myself on track and partial testing of code.  

I typed most of the README while the apk was busy being made, lol(edit: while the apk was busy failing to be made - after almost an HOUR - on the last step (again) and vomiting red flavoured text errors left-right-and-center).  

Ask an AI what parts of my code does if you want to get a general idea of how it works.  

## What each global dependency does (according to ChatGPT)
Great question ‚Äî understanding each of these helps you trim fat and only install what you actually need for your use case (especially if you're not dealing with media-heavy apps). Here's a clean breakdown of what each package does:  

üîß Core Tools  
Package	Purpose  
git	Used by Buildozer to fetch recipes or dependencies from GitHub  
zip, unzip	Used for compressing and extracting archives during build  
openjdk-17-jdk	Required for compiling Java code into an Android APK  
python3-pip	Needed to install Python packages via pip  

üïπÔ∏è SDL2-related (Kivy‚Äôs windowing/input/audio backend)  
Package	Purpose  
libsdl2-dev	Core SDL2 dev headers ‚Äî required for rendering/input in Kivy  
libsdl2-image-dev	Adds image format support (PNG, JPEG, etc.)  
libsdl2-mixer-dev	Adds sound format support (WAV, MP3, OGG, etc.)  
libsdl2-ttf-dev	Adds TrueType font rendering support  

If you're not using images, sound, or custom fonts, some of these may be optional ‚Äî but they're safe defaults for general Kivy apps.  

üéπ Multimedia (Video/audio playback)  
Package	Purpose  
libportmidi-dev	Enables MIDI support (used by some music/audio apps)  
libswscale-dev, libavformat-dev, libavcodec-dev	Required for video/audio processing (part of ffmpeg)  

If you don‚Äôt use video/audio/media streaming, these can be skipped.  

üóúÔ∏è Compression & File Handling  
Package	Purpose  
zlib1g-dev	Adds support for compressed data handling (used in various places)  
libffi-dev	Needed for calling C functions from Python (used by CFFI, PyJnius, etc.)  
libssl-dev	Required for HTTPS connections (requests, etc.)  

üé• GStreamer (advanced audio/video playback)  
Package	Purpose  
gstreamer1.0-plugins-base	Basic GStreamer plugins (used by Kivy for video/audio)  
gstreamer1.0-plugins-good	Recommended safe plugins  
gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad, gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly	Adds extra codec support (some may have licensing concerns)  
libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev	GStreamer development headers for building against  

Skip if you're not playing video or audio streams.  

üé® Input, Rendering, Fonts, and Images  
Package	Purpose  
libmtdev-dev	Enables multitouch input (for mobile/touch devices)  
libgl1-mesa-dev, libgles2-mesa-dev	Provide OpenGL ES support for rendering (used by Kivy)  
libsqlite3-dev	Needed if you use SQLite database in your app  
libjpeg-dev	For JPEG image support (used by Pillow)  
libfreetype6-dev	For font rendering support (used by Pillow, Kivy, etc.)
